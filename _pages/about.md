# About

A collection of methods that describe how teams can put human-centered design into practice. These cards are focused on design in the context of digital services, but can be adapted to non-technical design projects as well.

## The basics of human-centered design
Human-centered design is a methodology that incorporates feedback from the people for whom you are designing throughout the design process. The goal of human-centered design is to end up with a solution that is tailored to meet people's needs, with little wasted effort and reduced risk. To achieve this goal, design teams at 18F talk with and observe real users to understand their needs, context, and challenges, come up with design concepts that might address these challenges, and then test them with real users. [Learn more about the benefits and techniques of human-centered design](http://www.designkit.org/human-centered-design).

## Using the Method Cards
The Method Cards are broken up into the four broad design phases your team is likely to go through during a project. While some cards refer to other methods, you may use them independently. You do not need to use all the cards in a section or complete certain tasks before moving on to others. Take whatever cards are most useful to your team and incorporate more tools as youâ€™re ready.
